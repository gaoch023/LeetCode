weka/classifier/classifier
This gives a uniform interface for building and using classifiers from other Java code.
It contains three methods:buildClassifier() and classifyInstance() and distributionForInstance(), which all of these learning algorithms have to implement.
The learning algorithms are represented by subclasses of Classifier.
buildClassifier():Generates a classifier
classifyInstance():Classifies the given test instance
distributionForInstance():Returns a probability distribution for a given instance.(Calculates the class memberships probabilities for a given instance.)
